# Tip-Calculator
A simple page to calculate the value of a tip from an initial bill. Displays the tip percentage, tip value, and total value. Built using Bootstrap and vanilla JavaScript.

Somewhat WIP. Can improve things slightly, primarily formatting. Would be nice to show the tip percentage as the slider moves too.
